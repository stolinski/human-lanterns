### Generators

#### Model Generator

To generate a boilerplate model run:

    node gen.js gen:modelname

 This creates app/models folders if they don't already exist and creates a modelname.js file inside with barebone required title and body text field and commented out Mongoose schema types.

 Very soon 'gen:' will generate the boilerplate for views (using ejs), controllers, and models and other commands like 'model:' will be used to just generate the model.
